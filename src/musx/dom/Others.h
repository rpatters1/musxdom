/**
 * @class BeatChartElement
 * @brief A single beat chart element from Finale's music spacing system.
 *
 * Beat charts define graphical spacing in measures with custom horizontal layout.
 * They typically consist of a control element followed by several beat positions,
 * each indicating its duration, position, and spacing information.
 *
 * Each instance corresponds to a `<beatChart>` XML node.
 * Only one `<control>` is expected per measure (inci = 0), and it must precede other entries.
 *
 * The cmper is the 1-based measure number for the beat chart.
 * The inci is a 0-based index into the list of elements in that measure’s beat chart.
 * The cmper is shared among all entries for a given measure; inci increases with each new item.
 *
 * Only inci 0 has the `Control` instance, but this control data is needed by all subsequent
 * elements in the same measure. The only data member of interest in inci 0 is the control. Inci 0
 * is not a member of the list but rather a header.
 *
 * After automatic note spacing, the pos / endPos fields contain the “ideal width” for each
 * duration, based on the Music Spacing settings in Document Options. Any additional space is
 * represented in the minPos fields.
 *
 * For any beat chart array of N elements, the display width for element `n` may be calculated as:
 *
 * ```
 * Evpu16 nextMinPos = (n < N - 1) ? element[n + 1].minPos : control->minWidth;
 * Evpu16 width = MAX(element[n].endPos - element[n].pos, nextMinPos - element[n].minPos);
 * ```
 *
 * If the user manually edits a beat chart, Finale transitions the array from automatic to manual
 * as follows: The first pos is set to the first minPos, and then the width value (as calculated
 * above) is used to determine the rest of the pos and endPos fields. The final endPos value
 * is stored in totalWidth. Finale also sets the first minPos to 0 and all others (including
 * control->minWidth) to 1.
 *
 * The control->allotWidth member has a purpose and effect, but it has proved elusive to document
 * exactly how it works.
 *
 * This class is identified by the XML node name "beatChart".

 * @class PageTextAssign
 * @brief Represents a page text assignment with positioning and page range properties.
 *
 * Instances of #PageTextAssign use page assignment IDs rather than straightforward page numbers.
 * This allows their page assignments to shift based on how many leading blank pages exist in the
 * current score or part view vs. all the others. If all score and parts have the same number of
 * leading blank pages, then page assignment IDs are the same as page numbers.
 *
 * If the cmper is non-0, the #startPage and #endPage values are not used and the cmper
 * specifies a page assignment ID that defines which page this text is assigned to.
 *
 * If the cmper is 0, the #startPage and #endPage values specify the range of page assignment IDs to which
 * this text is assigned. An #endPage of 0 indicates the last page of the document.
 *
 * If cmper is non-zero, #startPage and #endPage should have the same value as the cmper.
 *
 * The inci value specifies a particular page text when more than one exists for the cmper value.

 * This class is identified by the XML node name "pageTextAssign".

/**
 * @class SplitMeasure
 * @brief Defines the split point(s) where a measure may be divided between two systems. A measure can only
 * split once, but Finale stores them as an array. Perhaps this was intended to support alternative
 * break positions depending on spacing. See the warning below for the actual behavior.
 *
 * The array entries are Evpu offsets in Scroll View. Determining the exact split location would require
 * converting between Scroll View Evpu positions and beat positions, which in turn depends on understanding
 * beat charts and Finale’s layout process. A crude first approximation may be to divide the split position by
 * #Measure::width, which might yield a usable fraction of the graphical measure width to display on the
 * previous system.
 *
 * @note This is a legacy Finale feature. It was never consistently implemented across the program,
 * and over time it became less useful as newer features were developed without support for it.
 * As a result, split points are rare in Finale files. The older the file, the more likely they are to appear,
 * but even then they remain uncommon.
 *
 * @warning Early versions of Finale could create multiple split points, while recent versions allow only one.
 * Older files that contain multiple split points can still be opened and saved in newer Finale releases (even as
 * recent as 27.4) without removing them. In all versions tested, however, multiple split points lead to crashes
 * or unstable measure layouts. They are effectively unusable in any version of Finale.
