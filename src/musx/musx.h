/** @mainpage
 * Welcome to the <b>Musx Document Model</b>.
 *
 * Use the <b>navigation buttons</b> at the top of this page to browse through
 * the framework documentation.
 *
 * The Musx Document Model is a <b>C++ class framework</b>
 * around the EnigmaXml format embedded in `.musx` files generated by Finale music software.
 * It requires the C++17 standard.
 * 
 * Features include:
 * - Dependency-free class definitions.
 * - Factory classes separate from object model classes.
 * - Xml Deserializer interfaces that allow the caller to use any Xml utility for xml handling.
 *
 * The following macro definitions are available to modify behavior of the library.
 * - `MUSX_DISPLAY_NODE_NAMES`: Log each node name that is processed in the order found. (When verbose logging is specified.)
 * - `MUSX_THROW_ON_UNKNOWN_XML`: Throws `musx::factory::unknown_xml_error` if an unknown child node is encountered. Otherwise
 * it logs the message, which by default sends it to `std::cerr`. This macro does not affect unknown top-level nodes,
 * which are always silently skipped.
 * - `MUSX_THROW_ON_INTEGRITY_CHECK_FAIL`: Throws `musx::dom::integrity_error` if a class fails its integrity check.
 * Otherwise it it logs the message, which by default sends it to `std::cerr`.
 * - `MUSX_TEST_DATA_PATH`: Specifies the data path for test files. Normally only used for CI builds on GitHub or on the local machines.
 *
 * The recommended way to define these macros is from your make file or build project. They are primarily intended
 * for debugging.
 *
 * The EnigmaXml that is extracted from a `.musx` file follows the pattern that any missing node receives the default value.
 * This is mainly interesting for booleans and enums. The xml nodes for booleans only show up if they are `true`. The default
 * values for enums do not show up either, which means it is frequently difficult to know what their string values might be. For this
 * reason, default enum values are usually omitted from the `XmlEnumMapping` tables.
 *
 * <b>The Musx Document Model project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Finale or its parent company</b>.
 * - It is an independent open-source library designed to help users access and convert their own data in the absence of Finale, which has been discontinued.
 * - It does not contain any Finale source code.
 * - It is not capable of writing Finale files, only reading them.
 * - It has been separately developed by analyzing the contents of EnigmaXml files and other publically available resources, such as the [PDK Framework](https://pdk.finalelua.com/) for Finale and Jari Williamssonâ€™s [original site](https://www.finaletips.nu/frameworkref/index.html).
 * - Nothing in the repository circumvents digital copy protection on the Finale application.
 *
 * (This reference web-site is generated directly from the source code by the Doxygen application.)
