/// This function owns the entire visibility decision. Finale suppresses a fretboard from the chord assignment,
/// from @ref dom::options::ChordOptions, and from the staff in effect at the chord's position, and all three
/// are checked here. Callers need not consult them, and in particular need not resolve a
/// @ref dom::others::StaffComposite of their own to do so.
/// @param chord Chord assignment whose fretboard is to be resolved.
/// @param keySignature Effective key signature for the chord's staff and measure.
/// @param keyContext Whether the written or concert key-signature interpretation should be used.
/// @return Display data, or std::nullopt when no fretboard is displayed for this chord or when its source
/// data is unavailable.
